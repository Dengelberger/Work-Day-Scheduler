# Work-Day-Scheduler

For this activity we had to create an interactive day planner with indications of past, present, and future time slots.  
We had to use local storage for the user to be able to add items to the middle column and save using buttons at the right.  When the page is refreshed, those items would remain using localStorage.get or something similar.

I used dynamic rendering of HTML code because the task of making the rows and columns was repetitive.  It was a learning experience, and I walked away knowing much more about how I was coding, but also two benefits of the dynamic rendering. 1) I could make the schedule using a great deal less coding, and 2) in the process of dynamically creating the HTML I created variables, id tags, etc. that I used later in the on-click events and the rendering of the color coding based upon time of day.

I also learned that loops are my friend, and that $(this) and .prev() are very helpful tools to have!
